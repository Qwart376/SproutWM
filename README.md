## Sprout Window Manager

<div align="center">
  <h1><strong>SproutWM/strong></h1>
  <p>
    <strong>A drop-in window manager for Windows designed to run on top of anything, even other window managers</strong>
</div>
  
 
## Purpose of Sprout:
SproutWM is a drop-in window manager - It will work regardless whenever Window's window manager is running or not, without leaving any traces nor mess behind as it uses minimize/restore gimmick rather than built-in workspaces. Thanks to this SproutWM can be used on computers that don't belong to you, or if you don't want to replace Window's WM

IMPORTANT: Disabling window animation is recommended, as it greatly improves smoothness of switching
